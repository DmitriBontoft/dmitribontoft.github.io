I've generally been an integrator of web designs by other people but I wanted to understand better why and how we do things the way we do.

So here is a playground where I'm playing with different approaches to see what works and what doesn't. It's easy to find suggestions on Web design which don't always work in practice, here's where I find out. 

Hopefully it will get better over time.
